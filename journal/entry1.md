# chapter 1 of DOET
Today I read Chapter 1 of The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman. This was actually a refresher for me because this is such a widely recommended book in the design world. The chapter focuses on how so many of our everyday frustrations come not from us being careless or clumsy, but from bad design. The author writes, “If I were placed in the cockpit of a modern jet airliner, my inability to perform gracefully and smoothly would neither surprise nor bother me. But I shouldn't have trouble with doors and switches, water faucets and stoves” (8). This highlights the importance of human centered design and how bad design is actually not our fault. 

I am always fascinated by signifiers and affordances. Norman describes affordances as possible actions while signifiers tell you where the action should happen. The classic example being a door where one side has a flat panel and the other has a handle. While this is a great example of signifiers and affordances this does not mean that it is technically good design.
