DOET Ch.4 Part.2

The second part of chapter four focused on how the best designs communicate through their form, sound, and layout, not through manuals or labels. 

Norman introduced the concept of forcing functions, which serve two main purposes: to lock in or to lock out certain actions. I experience lock in features regularly, especially in school. For instance, when I try to close a document before saving, the program prompts me to save my work, something that has rescued me more times than I can count. These small design choices prevent major user errors and highlight how thoughtful constraints can make technology more forgiving.

He then discussed conventions, constraints and affordances which show how cultural differences shape what feels “intuitive.” I really related to  Norman's shower example because I have been very lucky to travel to other countries and I can confidently say that everyone has a different design for a shower. It sometimes can be a fun exercise to figure it out but when you accidentally turn a knob and get freezing cold water it's no longer fun. So while it might seem unconventional to me it probably is the norm or cultural standard in that country. 

Chapter 4 also directly correlates to the sound project that we are doing in ian class right now. It was a good guide for navigating functional vs aesthetic sounds and helped me figure out how I wanted to use sound in that project. With the conversation of accessibility on the rise, sound has become an integral part of design. He makes a good point that sound can be helpful but not always necessary. It’s our job as designers to know the difference.

Lastly,I had never heard the word skeuomorphic before reading this book but it essentially is  a design principle that incorporates elements of real-world objects into digital or other designs to create a sense of familiarity and reduce the learning curve. The example he provides is adding engine growls to electric cars. It’s a clever way to connect new technology to something people already understand.
