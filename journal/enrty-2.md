chapter 2 of DOET - The Psychology of Everyday Actions

Reading Chapter 2 gave me a new appreciation for how psychology influences the way we interact with everyday objects. Norman’s central message is that design should accommodate how people actually think and behave, not how designers wish they did.

Norman introduces the Seven Stages of Action, which explain how we form goals, plan actions, execute them, and then evaluate the results. The examples he used, like turning on a light or learning to drive, show how these stages shift from conscious effort to subconscious behavior once we gain experience.

Overall, my biggest takeaway from Chapter 2 is that understanding the way people think, act, and even make mistakes allows designers to bridge the “gulfs” between intention and action. It’s a humbling reminder that good design isn’t about making users smarter, it’s about making systems more human.
