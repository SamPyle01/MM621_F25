<h1>chapter 2 of DOET - The Psychology of Everyday Actions

Reading Chapter 2 gave me a new appreciation for how psychology influences the way we interact with everyday objects. Norman’s central message is that design should accommodate how people actually think and behave, not how designers wish they did. I know that my own personal experiences with bad design is very frustrating. One that comes to mind is the last time that I tried to use the CSUEB web site (sorry CSUEB). Links that lead to nowhere or links that don't work, search bars that don't search, etc. this is a classic example of how a bad design led to my frustration and self blame. 

Norman introduces the Seven Stages of Action, which explain how we form goals, plan actions, execute them, and then evaluate the results. The examples he used, like turning on a light or learning to drive, show how these stages shift from conscious effort to subconscious behavior once we gain experience. Another personal example that I feel is beneficial for this class is my understanding of VS code. In the beginning I could barely keep track of my files and now it feels as easy as turning on a light switch. My coding skill still needs some work but I know that will get easier with practice as well. 

Overall, my biggest takeaway from Chapter 2 is that understanding the way people think, act, and even make mistakes allows designers to bridge the “gulfs” between intention and action. It’s a humbling reminder that good design isn’t about making users smarter, it’s about making systems more human.
