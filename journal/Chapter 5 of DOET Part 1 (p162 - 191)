##Chapter 5 of DOET Part 1 (p162 - 191)

In Chapter 5, Norman challenges the idea that “human error” is actually the user’s fault. Instead, he argues that what we typically blame on people is almost always the result of poor design. If a system requires too much memory, forces users to multitask, or hides important information, it basically creates a situation where mistakes are inevitable. Norman introduces two main types of errors: slips and mistakes. Slips happen when you intend to do one thing but accidentally do something else. Like pressing the wrong button or choosing the wrong menu item. Mistakes, on the other hand, happen when your plan or understanding is wrong from the start, often because the system didn’t give you the right information.

He also breaks down slips into categories like action-based slips, doing the wrong action, and memory lapses, forgetting a step. Mistakes can be rule-based or knowledge-based, depending on whether you applied the wrong learned rule or simply didn’t have enough understanding to make the right choice. What stood out to me is Norman’s insistence that these errors reveal design flaws, not personal failures. When systems are confusing, stressful, or badly mapped, they practically set users up to fail. Norman believes designers should anticipate where errors might occur and build systems that either prevent them or make recovery easy and safe.

One takeaway from this chapter is how much more forgiving I’ve become toward myself when I make everyday mistakes. Instead of instantly thinking “I’m so careless,” I now recognize that the design probably didn’t support the way my brain works. It actually makes me rethink the interfaces and products I use every day. Another takeaway is how important it is, as a designer, to assume that people will make mistakes. Instead of expecting users to be perfect, we should be designing systems that guide them gently, help them recover, and won’t punish them for being human.
